Assessment: Write a program that will allow storing and updating teacher data .

I have made a console menu driven code which performs following operations:
1.View Teacher Data
2.Add Teacher Data
3.Update Teacher Data
4.Delete Teacher Data

Here I have used list data structure which can add,update and remove data dynamically. 

I have added 3 Teacher Data respectively. 
1.View Teacher Data : This function displays data
2.Add Teacher Data: This function adds ID,Name,Class and Section of the Teacher 
3.Update Teacher Data: This function Updates the name of Teacher.
4.Delete Teacher Data: This function Deletes the individual Teacher data.
